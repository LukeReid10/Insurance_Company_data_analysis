This project is based on a large data set of insurance policyholder data, analysing risk factors such as age, sex, BMI, smoker status, children and claims incurred.

I first performed some data validation checks using a pandas DataFrame in Python, then cleaned the large data set. I then implemented some statistical analysis to get a general understanding of the data.

Next, I created a Power BI Dashboard for visualistion, which highlights the key data-driven insights represented by graphs and charts.

Finally, I produced a 6-page written report documenting my company recommendations based on the insurance policyholder data.
